PSET 11 - Stefanos Stoikos - Block Stacking Algorithm - Dynamic Programming

You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i), width w(i) and depth d(i) (all real numbers). You want to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box.

I have submitted the following files:
-README.txt: this file which explains what I have done
-Solution.java: A java solution file w/comments.
-documentation.txt file: Explain my code a bit further, why it works, run-time, etc.

How to run code.
Disclaimer: You will need to be able to compile the file using jdk compiler
Step 1: Navigate to the Solution Folder
Step 2: Using the command javac Solution.java, compile the file, it will hopefully produce 2 CLASS files 
Step 3: Place the input file on the same Location as the Solution.java file inside the folder 
Step 4: Using the terminal, and the command java Solution <inputfilename.txt> <outputfilename.txt> run the code 
Step 5: The desired result should be printed at the terminal and the output file should be created at the same location as the Solution file
