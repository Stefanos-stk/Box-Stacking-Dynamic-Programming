PSET 11 - Stefanos Stoikos

I have submitted the following files:
-README.txt: this file which explains what I have done
-Solution.java: A java solution file w/comments.
-Documentation file: Explain my code a bit further, why it works, run-time, etc.

How to run code.
Disclaimer: You will need to be able to compile the file using jdk compiler
Step 1: Navigate to the PSET11-StefanosStoikos-Solution Folder
Step 2: Using the command javac Solution.java, compile the file, it will hopefully produce 2 CLASS files 
Step 3: Place the input file on the same Location as the Solution.java file inside the folder 
Step 4: Using the terminal, and the command java Solution <inputfilename.txt> <outputfilename.txt> run the code 
Step 5: The desired result should be printed at the terminal and the output file should be created at the same location as the Solution file
